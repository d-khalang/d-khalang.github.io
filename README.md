https://d-khalang.github.io/ is a webpage that I've coded for a frontend assignment with the following Requirements.
I tried to make it for an imaginary cold brew company for which I used chatGPT, midjourney, and Bing to generate the content and images.

Requirements
"""Create a product sales page with the following elements:
- header: logo, menu with links leading to different places in the page, social media links
- slider with 3 images that can be navigated (either with bullets or left-right)
- testimonials: carousel with 3 testimonials displayed at the same time and navigation through them
- product features: box with icon, title, text
- pricing table with 3 price variants and their characteristics
- contact form: name, email, phone, message, tick for terms and conditions agreement
- footer: logo, useful information links (terms and conditions, cookies, etc), copyright, newsletter registration form (no functionality)
- call to action in the page, leading to the price table"""
